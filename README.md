# Real-Time Object Tracking System

A real-time object tracking system that uses **YOLOv8** for object detection and **Deep SORT** for tracking. This system allows manual selection of an object from a video frame and tracks it throughout the video using a Flask web interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Manual selection of target object via bounding box
- ⚡ Fast object detection with YOLOv8
- 🧠 Reliable multi-object tracking using Deep SORT
- 💻 Real-time video streaming with Flask
- 🔄 Scalable for future deployment on IoT & embedded devices
